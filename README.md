DrupalPlanet
============

Drupal Planet aggregation project that uses angular extensively as a proof of concept.

Goals:
1. Heavy use of angular framework while still utilizing Drupal's site building tools including views and panels.
2. Use of straight forward angular markup for dynamic pages and blocks.
3. High performance even with thousands of node content.
4. Make DrupalPlanet content more organized and useful to the average reader.

Why?
This project serves as a proof of concept that you can leverage Angular with Drupal to create a highly scalable website combining the strengths of both platforms.

Drupal Planet was chosen because the Drupal Planet site is not all that useful to sort through thousands of rows of content: https://drupal.org/planet. Ideally we would like to use popularity metrics (such as Twitter retweet counts) to present a better experience for the Drupal news reader.
